# PWA "Add to Home Screen" Not Showing - Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ What We Fixed

2. ✅ All 4 required icons present
3. ✅ App rebuilt successfully
4. ✅ Service worker and manifest generated

## 🔍 Why "Add to Home Screen" Might Not Appear

Chrome on Android requires **ALL** of these conditions to show the install prompt:

### 1. ⚠️ **HTTPS Required** (Most Common Issue)
**Problem**: Chrome won't show install prompt on HTTP (non-secure) connections

**Check**: 
- Is your site accessed via `https://`?
- `http://` won't work (except localhost)

**Solutions**:
```bash
# If testing locally, the site MUST be deployed to a real server with HTTPS
# Services with free HTTPS:
# - Netlify (easiest)
# - Vercel
# - Cloudflare Pages
# - GitHub Pages
```

### 2. 📱 **Not Already Installed**
**Problem**: If the PWA is already installed, Chrome won't show the prompt again

**Check**:
1. Go to Chrome menu (⋮) → Settings → Site settings → All sites
2. Find your site
3. Check if "Installed app" shows
4. Or go to Android Settings → Apps → Look for "SavannaFX"

**Solution**: Uninstall the app first, then try again

### 3. 🚫 **Dismissed Too Many Times**
**Problem**: If you dismissed the prompt 3+ times, Chrome blocks it temporarily

**Check**: Chrome DevTools → Application → Manifest → Check for warnings

**Solution**: 
- Clear site data: Chrome → Settings → Site settings → Your site → Clear & reset
- Or wait 90 days (Chrome's cooldown period)
- Or use manual install method (see below)

### 4. ⏱️ **Engagement Criteria Not Met**
**Problem**: Chrome requires users to interact with the site before showing prompt

**Requirements**:
- User must visit site at least twice
- Visits must be at least 5 minutes apart
- User must interact (click, scroll, type)

**Solution**: Browse around your site for a few minutes, then come back later

### 5. 🌐 **Wrong Chrome Version**
**Problem**: Old Chrome versions may not support PWA fully

**Check**: Chrome → Settings → About Chrome → Should be v80+

**Solution**: Update Chrome from Play Store

## 🛠️ Manual Install Method (Always Works)

Even if the auto-prompt doesn't appear, users can ALWAYS install manually:

### On Android Chrome:

1. **Tap the menu** (⋮) in top-right corner
2. **Look for one of these options**:
   - "Add to Home screen" ⬅️ Most common
   - "Install app"
   - "Install SavannaFX"
3. **Tap it** → Confirm → Done! ✅

The app will appear on home screen like a native app.

## 🧪 Testing Your PWA Right Now

### Option A: Test on Production (Recommended)

1. **Deploy your built app** to Netlify/Vercel/etc.
2. **Visit the HTTPS URL** on your Android device
3. **Browse for 2-3 minutes** (open signals, dashboard, etc.)
4. **Close Chrome completely**
5. **Reopen and visit again** after 5+ minutes
6. **Check Chrome menu** (⋮) → Should see "Add to Home screen"

### Option B: Test Locally with HTTPS Tunnel

```bash
# Install ngrok or use Cloudflare Tunnel
npm install -g ngrok

# Build your app
npm run build

# Preview it
npm run preview
# (Runs on http://localhost:4173)

# In another terminal, create HTTPS tunnel
ngrok http 4173

# Visit the https://xxx.ngrok.io URL on your Android
# Chrome will see it as HTTPS and allow PWA install
```

### Option C: Use Chrome DevTools (Desktop Testing)

1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Preview: `npm run preview`
3. Open http://localhost:4173 in **Chrome Desktop**
4. Open DevTools (F12) → Application tab
5. Check **Manifest** section for errors
6. Click **Install** button in address bar (⊕)

## 📋 PWA Install Checklist

Before testing on Android, verify all these:

### In Browser DevTools (Desktop Chrome)
- [ ] Open http://localhost:4173 (after `npm run preview`)
- [ ] F12 → Application → Manifest
  - [ ] No errors showing
  - [ ] All icon paths load correctly
  - [ ] "Installable" shows ✓
- [ ] Application → Service Workers
  - [ ] Service worker registered
  - [ ] Status: "activated and running"

### On Android Device
- [ ] Site is HTTPS (or localhost via tunnel)
- [ ] Chrome version 80+
- [ ] Not already installed
- [ ] Visited site and interacted
- [ ] Chrome menu (⋮) → Check for "Add to Home screen"

### In Manifest File (`dist/manifest.webmanifest`)
- [ ] `start_url` is correct
- [ ] `display: "standalone"`
- [ ] Icons have correct paths
- [ ] All 4 icon files exist in `dist/`

## 🔧 Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Force Chrome to Re-evaluate

```bash
# Clear site data in Chrome
Chrome → Settings → Site settings → [Your Site] → Clear & reset

# Then rebuild and redeploy
npm run build
# Deploy to hosting
```

### Fix 2: Check Manifest Validity

Visit your deployed site and check:
```
https://your-site.com/manifest.webmanifest
```

Should show JSON with all your PWA config. If 404, icons are misconfigured.

### Fix 3: Verify Service Worker

Open Chrome DevTools on your Android device:
1. Enable USB debugging on Android
2. Connect to computer
3. Chrome Desktop → `chrome://inspect`
4. Find your device → Inspect
5. Check Application → Service Workers

## 📱 What Users Will See After Install

Once installed successfully:

### Android Home Screen
- ✅ SavannaFX icon (your gold logo)
- ✅ App name: "SavannaFX"
- ✅ Looks like native app

### When Opening App
- ✅ Splash screen (gold theme)
- ✅ Full-screen (no browser chrome)
- ✅ Appears in app switcher
- ✅ Can pin to taskbar

### Long-Press Menu
- ✅ App info
- ✅ Shortcuts:
  - "Signals" → Opens `/dashboard/signals`
  - "Dashboard" → Opens `/dashboard`

## 🚀 Recommended Testing Flow

### Step 1: Deploy to Production
```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify (example)
# Install Netlify CLI: npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### Step 2: Test on Android
1. Visit your HTTPS site
2. Browse around (open signals, dashboard)
3. Close Chrome
4. Wait 5 minutes
5. Reopen Chrome → Visit site again
6. Chrome menu (⋮) → "Add to Home screen"

### Step 3: Verify Installation
1. Check home screen → SavannaFX icon should appear
2. Tap icon → App opens full-screen
3. Test offline: Turn off wifi → App should still load
4. Test shortcuts: Long-press icon → See Signals/Dashboard

## 🐛 Still Not Working?

### Check These Common Issues:

1. **Favicon/Icon Errors**
   - Check browser console for 404 errors
   - Verify all icon files in `public/` folder
   - Icons must be PNG format

2. **Service Worker Not Registering**
   - Check `dist/sw.js` exists after build
   - Check browser console for SW errors
   - Must be HTTPS or localhost

3. **Manifest Not Loading**
   - Check `dist/manifest.webmanifest` exists
   - Visit `https://your-site.com/manifest.webmanifest` directly
   - Should return JSON (not 404)

4. **CORS Issues**
   - Icons must be same-origin or CORS-enabled
   - Check hosting service CORS settings

## 📞 Quick Test Command

Run this to verify your PWA setup:

```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Check generated files
ls -lh dist/manifest.webmanifest dist/sw.js dist/pwa-*.png

# Preview
npm run preview

# Visit http://localhost:4173 in Chrome
# Press F12 → Application → Manifest → Check for errors
```

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

1. **Desktop Chrome**: Install button (⊕) appears in address bar
2. **Android Chrome**: "Add to Home screen" in menu (⋮)
3. **DevTools**: Application → Manifest shows "Installable: ✓"
4. **No Console Errors**: Related to manifest or service worker

## 🎯 Expected Timeline

From clean state to working PWA:

- **Immediate**: Desktop Chrome install works
- **5-10 minutes**: Android shows prompt (after browsing)
- **Or use manual**: Always works via Chrome menu (⋮)
