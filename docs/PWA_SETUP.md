# PWA Setup Guide for SavannaFX

## ✅ Completed Steps

1. ✅ `vite-plugin-pwa` installed (v1.2.0)
2. ✅ `vite.config.ts` configured with full PWA settings
3. ✅ `index.html` updated with PWA meta tags

## 📋 Next Steps to Complete PWA Setup

### Step 1: Generate PWA Icons

You need to create PWA icons from your logo. You have two options:

#### Option A: Use PWA Asset Generator (Recommended - Automatic)

```bash
# Install the tool globally
npm install -g @vite-pwa/assets-generator

# Generate all icons automatically from your logo
npx @vite-pwa/assets-generator --preset minimal public/assets/logo.png
```

This will automatically generate:
- `pwa-192x192.png`
- `pwa-512x512.png`
- `pwa-maskable-192x192.png`
- `pwa-maskable-512x512.png`
- Apple touch icon

#### Option B: Use Online Tool (Easy - Manual)

1. Go to https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Upload your `public/assets/logo.png`
3. Download the generated icons
4. Extract and place these files in your `public/` folder:
   - `pwa-192x192.png`
   - `pwa-512x512.png`
   - `pwa-maskable-192x192.png`
   - `pwa-maskable-512x512.png`

#### Option C: Use ImageMagick (Manual Control)

If you have ImageMagick installed:

```bash
# Create 192x192 icon
magick public/assets/logo.png -resize 192x192 public/pwa-192x192.png

# Create 512x512 icon
magick public/assets/logo.png -resize 512x512 public/pwa-512x512.png

# For maskable icons, add padding (20% on each side)
magick public/assets/logo.png -resize 384x384 -gravity center -extent 512x512 -background transparent public/pwa-maskable-512x512.png
magick public/assets/logo.png -resize 154x154 -gravity center -extent 192x192 -background transparent public/pwa-maskable-192x192.png
```

### Step 2: Create Screenshots (Optional but Recommended)

Screenshots help users preview your app before installing:

1. **Desktop Screenshot** (`public/screenshot-wide.png`):
   - Open your app in a browser at 1280x720 resolution
   - Take a screenshot of the dashboard
   - Save as `screenshot-wide.png` in `public/`

2. **Mobile Screenshot** (`public/screenshot-mobile.png`):
   - Open your app in mobile view (750x1334)
   - Take a screenshot of the signals page
   - Save as `screenshot-mobile.png` in `public/`

**Or skip screenshots for now** - They're optional. Comment out the `screenshots` section in `vite.config.ts` if you want to launch without them.

### Step 3: Build and Test

```bash
# Build the PWA
npm run build

# Preview the built app
npm run preview
```

### Step 4: Test PWA Installation

#### On Desktop (Chrome/Edge):
1. Open http://localhost:4173 (after `npm run preview`)
2. Look for the install button (⊕) in the address bar
3. Click to install
4. The app should open as a standalone window

#### On Android:
1. Deploy your built app to your hosting (e.g., Netlify, Vercel)
2. Open the site on your Android device
3. Chrome will show "Add to Home Screen" banner
4. Tap to install
5. App appears on home screen like a native app!

#### On iPhone (Limited PWA Support):
1. Open the site in Safari
2. Tap the Share button
3. Select "Add to Home Screen"
4. App appears on home screen (limited features)

### Step 5: Verify PWA Audit

Use Chrome DevTools to verify your PWA:

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to "Lighthouse" tab
3. Select "Progressive Web App" category
4. Click "Generate report"
5. Aim for 90+ score

## 🚀 Deployment Recommendations

### Netlify (Recommended for PWA)
```toml
# netlify.toml
[[headers]]
  for = "/manifest.webmanifest"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "application/manifest+json"
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate"

[[headers]]
  for = "/sw.js"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "application/javascript"
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
```

### Vercel
```json
// vercel.json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/sw.js",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Enable PWA in Development Mode

To test PWA features during development:

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
devOptions: {
  enabled: true, // Change to true
  type: 'module'
}
```

### Adjust Cache Sizes

Modify `maximumFileSizeToCacheInBytes` if needed:

```typescript
workbox: {
  maximumFileSizeToCacheInBytes: 3000000 // 3MB (current)
}
```

### Add More Shortcuts

```typescript
shortcuts: [
  {
    name: 'Events',
    url: '/dashboard/events',
    icons: [{ src: '/assets/logo.png', sizes: '96x96' }]
  }
]
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to register service worker"
- Build the app first (`npm run build`)
- Service workers only work in production or with `devOptions.enabled: true`
- Use HTTPS or localhost

### "PWA not installable"
- Check all icon files exist
- Verify manifest.json is generated (check browser DevTools → Application → Manifest)
- Ensure HTTPS (required for PWA)

### "Icons not showing"
- Clear browser cache
- Rebuild the app
- Check icon paths in `public/` folder

### "Offline mode not working"
- Service worker needs to be registered
- Visit the site at least once online
- Check Application → Service Workers in DevTools
