# Google Play Store Submission Guide for SavannaFX

## App Monetization Classification

### ✅ **Category: FREE App with In-App Purchases**

**Reasoning:**
- Your app uses a **freemium model** - users can download and use the app for free
- New users receive free subscriptions initially (`amount_paid: 0.00`)
- Premium features are unlocked through in-app subscriptions ($50/month or $0.50 per pip)
- Additional paid services like one-on-one mentorship ($299-$1499) are available
- All payments occur **within the app**, not at download

**❌ DO NOT** categorize as a paid app because:
- Users don't pay upfront to download
- The app is accessible without payment
- Monetization happens through in-app purchases/subscriptions

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Google Play Billing Integration Required

**Your app currently creates subscriptions directly in the database without Google Play Billing integration. This will cause your app to be REJECTED by Google Play.**

### Required Actions Before Submission:

1. **Integrate Google Play Billing Library**
   - Your app must use Google Play Billing API for all in-app purchases
   - Cannot process payments outside of Google Play's system
   - Current implementation bypasses Play Billing (violates policy)

2. **Recommended Solution: Use RevenueCat**
   ```bash
   npm install react-native-purchases
   ```
   - Handles Google Play Billing automatically
   - Cross-platform (Android + iOS)
   - Manages subscription lifecycle
   - Server-side receipt validation

3. **Alternative: Direct Integration**
   ```bash
   npm install react-native-iap
   ```
   - More control but more complex
   - Requires manual handling of subscription states
   - Need server-side verification

4. **Update Subscription Flow**
   - Remove direct database subscription creation
   - Replace with Play Billing purchase flow
   - Verify purchases server-side
   - Sync Play subscriptions with your database

### Current Issue:
```typescript
// ❌ CURRENT (Will be rejected):
const { error } = await supabase
  .from("signal_subscriptions")
  .insert({
    user_id: session.user.id,
    payment_status: "completed", // Direct DB insert
    amount_paid: activePricing.price,
  });

// ✅ REQUIRED (Google Play Billing):
import Purchases from 'react-native-purchases';

const purchase = await Purchases.purchasePackage(package);
// Then verify and sync with your database
```

**Timeline**: This integration typically takes 1-2 weeks. Do NOT submit until this is complete.

## Important Considerations

### ⚠️ Financial Services Compliance

Since your app provides trading signals:

1. **Disclaimers Required**:
   - "This app provides educational information only"
   - "Not financial advice"
   - "Trading involves risk of loss"
   - "Past performance doesn't guarantee future results"

2. **Regulatory Compliance**:
   - Check if you need licenses in target countries
   - Some countries restrict financial trading apps
   - May need to exclude certain regions

### ⚠️ Subscription Management

**Current Issue**: Your app creates subscriptions directly in database without Google Play Billing integration.

**Before Launch**:
- [ ] Integrate Google Play Billing Library
- [ ] Verify purchases server-side
- [ ] Handle subscription lifecycle (renewal, cancellation)
- [ ] Sync Play Store subscriptions with your database

**Recommended Libraries**:
- `react-native-purchases` (RevenueCat) - Easiest
- `react-native-iap` - Direct Google Play Billing

### ⚠️ WhatsApp Integration

If your app sends WhatsApp messages:
- [ ] Ensure compliance with WhatsApp Business API ToS
- [ ] Include opt-in/opt-out mechanisms
- [ ] Handle user consent properly
- [ ] May need to declare messaging functionality

### ⚠️ Testing Requirements

**Internal Testing**:
- [ ] Create internal testing track
- [ ] Add testers (up to 100)
- [ ] Test subscription flow
- [ ] Test all core features

**Closed Testing** (Recommended):
- [ ] Create closed testing track
- [ ] Add testers via email or Google Groups
- [ ] Test for 1-2 weeks before production
