## Screenshots

### Mobile Views:
1. **Landing Page Mobile**: Clean header with hamburger menu and CTA
2. **Mobile Sidebar**: Full-screen overlay sidebar with navigation
3. **Bottom Navigation**: Fixed bottom bar with key sections (to be captured with logged-in state)
4. **Dashboard Cards**: Enhanced tiles with better spacing and touch targets (to be captured with logged-in state)

---

## Maintenance Notes

### Important Considerations:
1. **useIsMobile Hook**: Breakpoint set at 768px (matches Tailwind's `md` breakpoint)
2. **Bottom Nav Items**: Update `showInBottomNav` flag in `navItems` array to control visibility
3. **Safe Area Insets**: Ensure bottom navigation uses `safe-area-inset-bottom` class
4. **Icon Sizes**: Mobile uses 20px, desktop uses 18px for consistency
5. **Color Variables**: All colors use CSS custom properties for easy theming

### Common Modifications:
```typescript
// To add a new item to bottom nav:
{ 
  label: "Full Name", 
  shortLabel: "Short", // Used in bottom nav
  icon: IconComponent, 
  to: "/path", 
  showInBottomNav: true // Enable this
}
```
